# simple-demo

Use the environment config to set the configuraiton of the maps with your api key.  You can delete the clinician id and
host or just add your own if you have a more full API that has more content  WIth only 2 services and 1 office - and the 
office not having a location - I improvised on what to show.  I could have added fake doctor images or other stuff but 
I felt all that was superfluous.  

Let me know if you have any issues

Thanks,

Scott
