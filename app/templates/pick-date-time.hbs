        <h4>What to improve?</h4>
        <p>LOTS. I did not have a ton of time this week but if I had more time - here is a partial list of the
        things I would do to finish this out. I mean - I guess there is still time in the week so I could do all
        the rest of the things - but I don't know where the bar is for you guys.  Hopefully you don't judge too
        harshly</p>
        <p>Incidentally - I was going to grab more style stuff from your site but I figured the scope of the
        assignment was a little more along the lines of "make something bespoke" </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Localize the strings</li>
            <li>improve the styling</li>
            <li>Add more tests</li>
            <li>clean up the CSS</li>
            <li><span>Implement dark mode</span> ( Click the moon up there on the right )</li>
            <li> MORE TESTS</li>
            <li>Clean up some of the jenky component and route names</li>
            <li><span>Style this page :)</span></li>
        </ul>
